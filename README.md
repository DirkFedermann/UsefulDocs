# WSLStuff
Repository to house my WSL Documentations and Scripts
It is more for that I don't forget how to set up certain things that I have collected all over the internet, in case I have to install everything again, but since I wrote it, it would be a shame not to publish it.

If you find any errors or have issues, don't be afraid to contact me or make a pull request.

## Recommended Order
Even though all documents are in by itself helpful, it makes sence to set up a WSL before attempting to make SSL certificates for it.
